Unbuild
=======

A basic C++/XML based build system for small code projects. 

Usage:
unbuild compiler [path [options]]

Unbuild is a build tool similar to make, cmake and the likes that uses a basic, easy to read XML project format.
It supports MSVC, GCC and (possibly other) compilers and has been used in my other hobby projects.

Project Format
